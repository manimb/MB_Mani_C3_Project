Important Note:
===============

The base Restaurant finder stub code uses only the time information in all its processing.
such as LocalTime, getCurrentTime also uses the LocalTime.now(). These does not carry the date information.

For example the restaurant open times, close times in the restaurant class can hold only the time information.
So this repository code assumes that the restaurant open and close times are in the same dates.

=============================================================================================================

However if the restaurant open and close times span in two different dates, 
For example the restaurant opens in sept 27th, 10 PM and closes on Sept 28th 5 AM, that it if it overlaps two dates
the test cases will fail as we have only the time information whereas we need the date information also.
 
But there is no provision to hold date information for such an use case.

So Optionally, i have modified the stub to hold both date and time information using 
LocalDateTime at all places and run all the tests in another dseparate optional repository.

This optional modified repository is at
